    "The city of Buenos Aires, Federal District and capital of Argentina, is the most populated city in the Argentine Republic with a population of approximately 3,000,000 (2010) and the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires (AMBA), made up of the city of Buenos Aires and 40 surrounding *municipios*, 15,000,000 (2010), according to the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses of the Argentine Republic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The city of Buenos Aires is among the cities with the highest quality of life in Latin America, and its per capita income is among the three highest in the region. It is the most visited city in South America due to its cultural diversity, commerce, industry, politics, culture, and technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2010 national census estimated that approximately 2,000,000 immigrants born in another country resided in Argentina, equivalent to 4.5% of the population. At a global level, Argentina is ranked 29th for the number of immigrants in its territory, being the largest recipient of immigrants from Latin America and Buenos Aires being one of the main cities that houses this foreign population."
